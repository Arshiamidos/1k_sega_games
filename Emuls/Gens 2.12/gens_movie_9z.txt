New in version 9g:

      -bulletproof rerecording (out-of-order loading shouldn't cause desync anymore)
      -I think I caught a desync bug where a chunk of memory at the end of save states was never getting loaded...
      -continuous frame advance (and no pause required, with sound)
      -ctrl-T to toggle read-only (for switching to/from playback while recording)
      -0-9 keys to load save states 0-9 (not F0-F9 like several other emulators, because the F keys were used for too many things already)
      -shift+0-9 keys to save save states 0-9 (ctrl+0-9 to only select, now)
      -=/- for speedup/slowdown (automatically switches in/out of "slowdown mode" as necessary)
      -hold Tab to fast-forward (ctrl-shift-R to reset, now)
      -it no longer uses 100% CPU when it doesn't need to (this is a big one for me)
      -gave messages an outline (if you didn't set them to transparent) so they're not impossible to read on some bright backgrounds
      -allows you to choose record or playback while a movie is already recording or playing, which properly stops the current movie when you hit OK

----------------------------------- 	FAQ	----------------------------------------

Q: Why my movie doesn't play back correctly ?  It's desyncing.

A: The movie must be played in the same condition it has been recorded.  There are some settings  that are known to affect playback :

	-Rom version
	-Game pad configuration : 6 or 3 buttons ( doesn't affect earlier games)
	-Sound enabled or disable
	-Sound mixing frequency ( 11Khz , 22 Khz or 44Khz).  With NTSC, 44khz is recommended.  With PAL, 22khz and 44khz do fine
	-Battery Backed RAM data

Q: Why my movie played well the first time but not anymore ?

A: It's because of the battery backed ram.  Delete the .srm file.  However, you'll lose your save data !

Q: Why rerecording doesn't work with Sega CD ?

A: Sega CD loading times are not constant, but framerate is. As a result loadtimes may take more or less frames during playback than they did during recording
