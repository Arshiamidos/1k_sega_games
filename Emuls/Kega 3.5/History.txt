Kega Fusion v3.51 (C) Steve Snake 2006
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whats New ?
-----------

Quick Update:

* Fixed Netplay Connection issue.

* Fixed Netplay Dialogs in Fullscreen mode.

* Config of Player 1 (the Host) is now copied to other players in Netplay.

* Re-added another deleted line, the sound effects in Ecco work again.

* Fixed a Timing issue, Street Racer works again.

* Fixed DMA issue with Powermonger.

* Fixed SMS NMI issue.


That's all for now,

Snake.

Kega Fusion v3.5 (C) Steve Snake 2006
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whats New ?
-----------

Lots of stuff that I did months ago, and now have completely forgotten...
However here is the stuff that I remember doing.

* Rewrites to lots of Genesis and 32X side stuff. Should fix things I broke
  in 3.4, and is very slightly faster. Hopefully nothing is broken.

* Re-added one line of ASM to the 32X emulation which must have gotten
  deleted a long time ago. Now disolveable objects in Chaotix work again.

* Fixed the SegaCD Fader.

* Fusion now supports more MP3 formats than Winamp does - i.e. all of them.
  44100Hz Stereo is still recommended, but not neccessary.

* Seeking within MP3s works now. Not sure about VBR files though.

* Blackthorne 32X sound glitch fixed - it now performs exactly as on real
  hardware.

* Controller config rewrite. You can now define directions for controllers
  as well as buttons.

* VGM Log now logs VGM1.10 format files, which should be much smaller. You
  can change back to VGM1.01 if you need to by editing the VGM_Version
  setting in the INI file. (16,1 for VGM1.10, 1,1 for VGM1.01)

* Added 'ForceSWBuffer' sound compatibility option. This is set to 1 by
  default because this is the preferred option. However if you are getting
  no sound (due to buggy drivers), or your framerate fluctuates for no
  reason, you can try setting this to 0.

* Drag and drop support added.
 
* Brighten option for those that prefer a slightly brighter palette.

* Preliminary Netplay support. You MUST read the README.TXT to learn how to
  use this feature.

LOTS more stuff - if you find something, please tell me ;)

Happy new year!

Snake.

Kega Fusion v3.4 (C) Steve Snake 2005
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whats New ?
-----------

July 2nd, 2005:
---------------

* Split this file into README.TXT and HISTORY.TXT and basically redid
  README.TXT. Some of the info in there was very out of date, and there
  is some very important info I needed to add for this version.

* Fixed a minor sound issue I forgot to take care of last time.

* Rewrote High Priority stuff, now sets the priority differently.

* Added Keyboard Shortcut for CVBS TV Mode that I forgot to add before.

* Fixed GameGear Zoom with Render Plugins.

* Added option (set via ini file only) to disable the TV static effect.
  There isn't really any need to do this because it takes close to zero
  CPU time anyway. Still - StaticDisabled=1 turns it off.

* Fusion now remembers it's window coordinates between sessions.

* Added selectable (via ini file only) refresh rates for PAL and NTSC.
  See the section in README.TXT on EXPERT OPTIONS for more info.

* Added the ability to specify what video modes etc. are used, and to have
  the mode switched automatically. See the section in README.TXT on
  EXPERT OPTIONS for more info.

* Improved Command Line support. You can still specify which console to
  start up, as before, but now it should not be neccessary, as Fusion
  will try to detect this automatically. You can now specify options and
  filename in any order. You can now start Fusion without a file if you
  really want to.

* Changed all references to the SegaCD "Internal RAM" to "Built-In RAM" to
  match what the BIOS calls it. This will probably be less confusing to
  people trying to understand the following feature... I did not alter
  the filename used for "Per BIOS" saves, for compatibility reasons.

* Added new functionality to the Load RAM Cart option - now it is valid to
  load a Gens-style file here. You will be given the option to load the
  Built-In RAM or the Cartridge RAM part of this file. The part you select
  will be converted into Cartridge RAM and loaded, the original file will
  not be altered. Now it is much easier for you to copy data from either or
  both parts of a Gens save into your normal Built-In RAM file.

* Added File History. CTRL-ALT-L will load the most recently used file.
  (be sure to disable key shortcuts if you're likely to use these three
  keys while playing ;)) There is another (ini file only) option related
  to the File History - ShortenHistoryNames=1 will show just the file name
  rather than the full path name in the History.

* Fusion now supports the 'Illegal' 32X video mode correctly.

* Fixed crash bug that could occur if you tried to load some invalid file
  as a SegaCD image.

* Fixed occasional crash bug with The Incredible Hulk.

* Fixed a couple of problems I found with SMS/GG emulation - Terminator 2
  The Arcade Game (GameGear) no longer has palette problems as a result,
  this probably fixed other games too.

* Fixed Counter problem with Samurai Showdown.

* Fixed strange problem that could occur when loading certain games after
  Sonic 3.

* Fixed problem I seem to have introduced last year sometime with Sonic CD.

* Fixed excessive music slowdown issue with the Thunderforce games. Fusion
  now behaves exactly like the real hardware - meaning it still slows down
  sometimes, but only very slightly.

* Fixed problem that occurs when you die on the second level of SoulStar
  (SegaCD). The music and the game will now continue as normal.

I also made a lot of other changes to try to resolve certain other issues,
but the details of all that is unimportant.

July 13th, 2005:
----------------

Spent the last 11 days writing and rewriting and rewriting the following
until I was happy enough with it to release it:

* New Event System that allows me to trigger certain events on a cycle
  accurate basis, WITHOUT making any noticable performance hit. This code
  is still very experimental, and so far is enabled for Genesis/MegaDrive
  games only (its disabled when the 32X is in use.) I still need to refine
  this and make sure it doesn't break anything before I consider it done.
  The upshot of all this is basically that Sesame Street Counting Cafe now
  runs exactly as on a real console, for the first time. A lot of work for
  one (not very good) game? Hell yes ;) I don't think it will affect any
  other game but I guess we'll see. 

* Altered some other video related timings in order to make the above stuff
  work. This affects all consoles, hopefully in a positive way ;)

That's all for now,

Snake.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kega Fusion v3.3 (C) Steve Snake 2005
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well it took just a bit longer to get my life back than it was supposed to.
Hopefully things go well in the next month or so, because I still have some
major rewriting as well as some huge features planned. Would be a shame if
they don't happen.

Most of the changes in this version were done shortly after v3.2 was
released, right before any concept of 'free time' vanished completely.
I've forgotten most of what I did - there were some pretty major changes
behind the scenes, and I may have broken stuff / forgot to take some test
code out... but everything seems stable to me, so here goes. It's a big
one, and this is just what I made a note of...

Whats New ?
-----------

* Removed the BETA status. It was only really there because I never like to
  say something is finished until I'm done with it. But, yet again, some
  people won't bother to try 'Beta' software...

* Fixed problem relating to GameGear/Master System and saving GameGenie
  codes.

* Re-added code to look for MP3 ID3 tags. There should be no problem with
  MP3s now. However - if your MP3s are playing at the wrong speed, or not
  at all, then make sure they are 44100Hz Stereo MP3s! These are supposed
  to be CD Audio tracks, you know ;)

* Fixed silly problem where I forgot to alter the size of a YM2612 buffer.
  All YM2612 related sound problems should be gone, and the core should
  now be pretty much 100% accurate to real hardware.

* 32X PWM sound is now hardware accurate.

* Improved SMD/BIN detection, should have less problems loading odd sized
  BIN files.

* Added an option to set Fusion to run at High Priority. This option does
  a couple of other things too, such as change the way that Fusion gives
  up time to other apps (making it give up very little.) Probably makes
  sense to turn off 'Sleep while Waiting' while using this option, too.

* Rewrite of a fair bit of the Genesis VDP functions.

* Added another TV Mode, slightly less blurry (but not much)

* Added an option to disable all keyboard shortcuts (except the ESC key)
  for those people who had problems with accidentally triggering a menu
  while playing.

* Alt-Enter now switches between full screen / windowed as well as the
  ESC key. I never really liked this behaviour, but it was requested.

* Added another 'Fixed Aspect' option. Whereas the first will try to best
  fit the image within your display, this one basically does the opposite.
  Example: if you have a widescreen TFT monitor, this option will try to
  best fill the width of your monitor. Clipping may occur at the top and
  bottom instead of getting big black bars at the left and right. This
  also works the other way if your monitor is taller than it is wide.
  I know some people will prefer this.

* Fixed problems related to the Genesis OS ROM and resetting / saving /
  loading states.

* Added seperate folders for SMS and GG Patch (i.e. GameGenie) Files.

* Fixed bug where SMS Save States ended up in the Genesis Save State
  folder.

* Added Screenshot function. By default Fusion will save compressed TGAs,
  but since some art packages have problems with these, you can instead
  select uncompressed TGAs, or BMPs. Be aware though that these files can
  get quite big ;)

* Tidied up all use of Load/Save dialogs to prevent loading of non existant
  files, creating save states with invalid names, and other things that
  could be done accidentally.

* Fixed timing issue when sound is disabled.

* Added dialogs when the user attempts to use the SegaCD RAM cart options
  when the SegaCD is not running, hopefully this should help prevent all
  the confusion surrounding RAM carts.

* SegaCD RAM carts are now created as CRM files to distinguish them from
  internal BRM files. You can still load BRM files in the same way as
  before.

* When Fusion detects a Gens format BRM file, it will create a backup, and
  then create seperate BRM and CRM files out of it. It will also alert the
  user to the fact that it has done this. This should prevent people from
  managing to corrupt their save files among other things. Now all we need
  is to get Gens itself to do this and the nightmare will be over.

* Made a few changes to the way SegaCD BRM/CRM is loaded/saved in order to
  prevent any possibility of data loss (all related to the above).

* Fusion is now compatible with Windows XP Visual Styles.

* 32X emulation is now far more accurate. Primal Rage, Shadow Squadron,
  Toughman Contest, Pitfall, Virtua Racing and Mortal Kombat now perform
  exactly as on real hardware. Some of these problems took a HUGE amount
  of time to track down, and understand, but I think it's worth it. I
  don't believe any other emulator can run all of these games accurately.

* 32X BIOS is no longer required. This hasn't received any serious testing
  but seems to work fine. If Fusion cannot load one or more of the 32X
  BIOS files it will default to not using them. If you find any problems
  you should probably test with a real BIOS to make sure that isn't the
  cause.

* A MASSIVE amount of behind the scenes stuff and other stuff that I've
  forgotten. You may notice this version is faster/slower than previously,
  I'm really not sure about that yet ;)

Have fun, hopefully I fixed everything, and broke nothing.

Snake.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kega Fusion v3.2 BETA (C) Steve Snake 2005
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whats New ?
-----------

Again, another quick update:

* Fixed another YM2612 bug that I added in 3.11 - I accidentally deleted
  one line of code that I thought shouldn't be there while fixing the other
  bug from version 3.1. Doh.

* Rewrote another part of the YM2612 core. Should now be pretty much
  perfect.

* 32X PWM should now be the correct volume. I haven't noticed any nasty
  clipping yet, but if you do, just turn off overdrive.

* Slight change to SegaCD PCM. Don't know if this affects anything.

* Various internal changes that should hopefully make MP3 decoding work
  properly when VSync is on, or some slow render plugin is being used.

Now, this time, I really DO mean "Next update will come when I get my
life back." Hopefully this is only a month or so away. We shall see.


Snake.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kega Fusion v3.11 BETA (C) Steve Snake 2005
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whats New ?
-----------

VERY quick one...

* Fixed silly YM2612 bug that I added in the last version.

* Now selecting -fullscreen from the command line will not alter fullscreen
  setting in the INI file.

That's pretty much it, the last version was unusable because of the silly
YM2612 bug, so I needed to get a new version out quickly. I had a look at
the MP3 problem some people were reporting, and made a small change to
fullscreen mode which *might* help. I'll need to rewrite my entire CDDA
handling code to make any real improvement, though... Some other time.

Snake.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kega Fusion v3.1 BETA (C) Steve Snake 2005
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whats New ?
-----------

Just a quick update:

* Rewrote a big part of the YM2612 core. This should now be very close to
  perfect. However, I'm not in a position to give it any major testing, I
  may have broken something...

* Fixed 32X Border Colour.

* Slight alteration to MP3 support - not that I could get it to go wrong,
  but now it should work without problems on all systems.

* Fixed Fullscreen / Escape key problem when running from a command line.

* (Hopefully) Fixed Fullscreen problem when starting up. This is actually
  a graphics driver issue, but hopefully my workaround should eliminate
  the problem.

* Slight change to controller code, now invalid settings such as UP+DOWN at
  the same time cannot be performed.

The YM2612 core was the biggie, spent 99% of my free time on that one. I'm
sure I fixed a couple of other things too, but I forgot ;-)

Next update will come when I get my life back. I'm sure everybody will have
a big list of requested features by then :D


Snake.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kega Fusion v3.0 (Maple) BETA (C) Steve Snake 2005
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whats New ?
-----------

Well, since I only just got my PC back, and since my free time right now
is totally non-existant, far less than I hoped to have done. But rather
than delay this any longer, since I *have* added a lot of features that
various people have been asking for for a while now, I'm making another
release.

You may have noticed the big jump in the version number? Somebody commented
that they didn't bother trying Fusion, because of the low version number...
Well, since there has been Kega, Lazarus, and now Fusion, that makes this
Kega 3.0, right? ;-)

* Fixed problem with 32X PWM when changing SampleRate.

* Added Genesis Border Colour Emulation, and option to disable it.

* Small fix to 6 button pad code (Double Switch - thanks TascoDeluxe).

* Much improved Sega Mouse support.

* Config Dialog now remembers what page you were on :-)

* Removed ISO/BIN reading for SegaCD - this is now handled by the BIN/CUE
  engine. You won't notice any difference, but trust me, its better ;-)

* Fixed bug in BIN/CUE engine when multiple files were used.

* Added MP3 support to the BIN/CUE engine. Yes, this means that Fusion now
  supports ISO/MP3. Fusion uses the Windows Codec and therefore contains
  no patented algorithms. Too many people asked for this feature, so
  although I didn't really want it, it's now there.

* VSync now works in Windowed mode. Be aware that this can severely slow
  down the emulator, especially if your monitor is not set to a multiple
  of 50hz or 60hz, depending on the region of the game you are playing.

* Made improvements to both Standard and Alternate Timing modes.

* Added Pro Action Replay support for the Genesis.

* Added GameGenie and Pro Action Replay support for the GameGear and Master
  System.

* Added CodeFinder for Pro Action Replay.

* Fusion should now be compatible with WinXP Visual Styles.

* Added "Fast Forward" mode. Probably doesn't work if VSync is enabled...

* Various small optimisations.

* Fixed a couple of minor issues affecting the SegaCD BIOS CD Player only.

* When Fixed Aspect is disabled, Filtering is enabled, and you are running
  an NTSC (USA/JAP) game, the screen will now be slightly stretched. This
  works for all consoles. Stretching does not happen for PAL games, because
  PAL TVs show more lines than NTSC TVs, and because some PAL games use the
  extra portion of the screen (Virtua Fighter 32X, for example). And no, it
  doesn't completely remove the Master System border. That would look very,
  very wrong.

* Now supports up to 24 Render Plugins. This should now be way more than
  enough.

* Switched around the naming of the various Scanline modes. People like it
  better this way.

* Fusion will now start in fullscreen mode if it was exited from that mode.

* Other stuff that I've forgotten.


Still some major work planned for Fusion, once I get my life back...


Anyway, hope you like the additions to this release, and hope I didn't
break anything. I'll have to start documenting some of this stuff properly,
too.

Kega Fusion v0.1e BETA (C) Steve Snake 2004
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whats New ?
-----------

Well I wanted to add some new stuff before releasing another version, but
since people have been asking, and since I'm not going to be able to do
anything with it for a while due to "real life" getting in the way, I am
releasing the current version, which has many small changes and bugfixes.

To be honest I've forgotten most of what I fixed ;-) Anyway, here is the
stuff I remember:

* Fixed a small problem with the SegaCD CDD

* Fixed VGM issue

* Fixed "Streets of Rage" sound problem

* Discovered what some sound drivers do and worked around it (Thanks to
  Stone for testing), more machines should now work without having to drop
  to "Alternate Timing" mode

* Added "Sleep While Waiting" option - NOT recommended because it can cause
  skipping in the sound and the framerate of the emulator, also not really
  needed because the emulator *will* give up time to any running program
  automatically - but since so many people really want to see the task
  manager showing available CPU time, here it is. Use it if you must. But
  don't complain about choppy frame rates ;-)

* Upped the number of render plugins to 16

* Updated render plugin system to allow for 2x, 3x and 4x scalers. (Only
  works in Enhanced GFX mode)

* Render plugins can now go into a "Plugins" folder to avoid clutter

* Lots of other fixes which I really can't remember now.

More to come when my life gets back to something resembling "normal".

Snake.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kega Fusion v0.1d BETA (C) Steve Snake 2004
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whats New ?
-----------

Yet Another Quick Update:

* Fixed Turrican (Genesis)

* Improved Command Line Support

* Forgot to add the 6 button changes to Alternate Timing mode. Is there now.

* Added GameGear Zoom Mode

* Added "Scanlines 0%" option and seperated them from the other options. Now you can
  select the type of Scanlines you want in any of the renderers

* Switched Power On and Soft Reset around, hopefully people will now only use the
  Soft Reset function when its actually useful ;-)

* Added "ForceFullScreen32" INI file setting


Command Line works as follows:

Fusion gamename.ext [console] [country] [-fullscreen]

Console options are: -sms, -gg, -gen or -md or -32x, -scd or -mcd
Country options are: -usa -jap -eur or -auto

Default console is Genesis/Megadrive.
Default country is whatever is set in the INI file, i.e. whatever was last used.

Apart from the filename, which must come first, all options can be in any order,
and are optional.

When using the -fullscreen option, the ESCAPE key will exit the emulator.


Snake.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kega Fusion v0.1c BETA (C) Steve Snake 2004
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Whats New ?
-----------

Another Quick Update:

* Fixed Spiderman (32X)

* Fixed Joe and Mac (Genesis)

* Fixed Pirates Gold (Genesis)

* Fixed "Red Bar"

* Modified 6 Button Controller Code

* Added Command Line Support

* Another small modification to the Graphics code

* Added Message Box for first time run to try and cut down the number of
  people asking about the graphics settings...


Thats all for now,

Snake.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kega Fusion v0.1b BETA (C) Steve Snake 2004
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Whats New ?
-----------

Quick update:

* Fixed the problem whereby you couldn't define the space bar as a key.

* Modified Graphics Code. Should now work by default on more systems.

* Moved the INI file settings to the top of the file for easier access.

* Added Render Plugin Support

The Graphics stuff and INI file editing:

There are now 4 different modes you can try - by default it uses a more
compatible, but possibly slower mode. If everything works fine you can
try setting EnhancedGFXOpt to 1 to see if that also works - this is usually
the fastest mode. If neither enhanced mode 0 or 1 work, you can set
ForceCompatibleGFX to 1, and then try CompatibleGFXOpt at 0 or 1 to see
which is the fastest. Also, on some older cards the enhanced mode may be
quite slow - if this is the case you should use Compatible mode.

I hope that this now works on a much wider range of graphics cards - let
me know :)
