==============================================================

DGen is a Genesis/Megadrive emulator, which currently
runs under Windows 95/98/2000 and possibly NT using DirectX.

(The name is spelt "Capital D, Captial G, small e, small n",
and pronounced "Dee Jen".)

At this point I'll slip in the old standard disclaimer:
  I do not accept responsibility for any effects, adverse or otherwise,
  that this code may have on you, your computer, your sanity, your dog, 
  and anything else that you can think of. Use it at your own risk.

What's New?
-----------
V1.21
+ Switched to Richard Mitton's excellent RAZE Z80 emulator, which fixes
  the out of time music on some games.
  Most of you described the problem as 'the music isn't in
  sync with the game'. Anyway, this is now fixed.

+ Sonic1/2/3, Aladdin are all fine now. I imagine there will be others.
  Eternal Champions's music is okay and you can play the game with Musashi.

+ DAC sound plays at the right pitch now (e.g. 'Sega' chord, 'Eswat' speech)

- No shadows yet (e.g. Sonic2 bonus game)

Info
----
The default keys to the emulator are
Up,Down,Left,Right = Cursor keys (not on the numpad)
A,B,C              = A,S,D
Start              = Enter
X,Y,Z,Mode         = Q,W,E,R

V1.20
+ Fullscreen mode now works with high resolution graphics cards
  that don't support 320x240x16.

+ Triple buffering in fullscreen modes (disabled by default - select
  Graphics/Triple Buffering to enable it).

+ Fixed a DMA bug (fixes EA intro a bit)

+ Thinner mode now scales to the whole screen if Any Size is enabled.
  (e.g. Golden Axe front end, TMNT, SF2)

* Made Any Size the default

- No interpolation/bilinear filtering/Direct3D/Glide/3dFX
  support yet. Don't e-mail about this, I know you want it.

i There are still bugs in the jumping on Altered Beast, Alex Kidd,
  Rolling Thunder 2, and Eternal Champions.
  Another misemulation affects Columns's score.

i Speed is still bad. I know this because I myself don't have
  a fast computer.

V1.19
+ Fixed SRAM problems (e.g. Phantasy Star 4)
  Let me know what SRAM works now.
+ H-Interrupt fix (from 1.18) seems to have fixed a lot of games e.g.
  Sonic 1 Level 4, Mortal Kombat, Toe Jam and Earl (these games
  previously never worked at the same time - now they do).

V1.181
+ Fixed Escape in redefine keys routine
V1.18

+ Added .GYM logging at the request of Zophar
  (with and without DAC logging)
+ New DirectInput code

I've been tweaking a few things. If anything is broke and you
can't cope let me know within the next few weeks (date now is 17th Jan '00)
and I'll recompile 1.17 with GYM support.
In particular Sonic2 doesn't run (!), but if you switch to Musashi and
back you can work around this.

Also, the keyboard codes have changed.
If you have control trouble, click on the first entry in the Input menu.
This will reset the key codes.

If you haven't seen already, I'm doing some ROM testing on my
homepage (www.dtmnt.com). Go see if you can help - thanks!


--------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE - In the DOS version, press F1,F2 or F3 to strech the screen,
F1 being the fastest. The DOS version doesn't have sound.
Type dgen -help for more info on how to work it.
The rest of this file refers to the Windows version.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Automatically created configuration file is DGEN.INI,
which is usually created in the same directory
as where you run it (but Windows can be a bit unpredictable so you
may have to hunt around for it!).

Q: How fast is it?
A: Roughly speaking it compares like this:

Slow                                         Fast/
/Jerky graphics                              Smooth Graphics
  <------------------------------------------>
                DGEN            Genecyst
             Megasis            KGen

but hey - you can compare for yourself!
If you have a Pentium-I or below then I advise you to use KGen or Genecyst.
If you have a Pentium-III you should have no trouble.

Q: Why use it rather than Genecyst and KGen?
A1: It has interlace mode support
A2: DOS programs sometimes have trouble with newer graphics cards and
   sound cards. (It's happened to me a couple of times.)

Q: What's the compatibilty like?
A: Pretty good.

---------------------------------------------------------------

.gsx files are a bit like gs0-gs9 save states, so you may be able
to swap save states between emulators. Anyone got the actual
specs for Genecyst or KGen save states?

Dave's e-mail
dave@dtmnt.com
Take notice of this before sending me any mail:<br>
- No ROM requests.
- Asking is always better than demanding.
- If it's about the Mac version, don't ask me.
- Ask before sending files bigger than 100k.
- I will not be adding Sega CD, 32X, or DSP (e.g. Virtua Racing) support to DGen.
- I know that DGen needs a fast computer to run.
- I know about the lagging/slow sound problems.
- I don't want my web-site redesigning.
- I know about the fullscreen problems.
- I know that interpolation/higher resolution would be nice.
- MAME is much better that DTMNT now. (Ah yes but in its day 'twas the best there was.)
